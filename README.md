# Multiclient Creator

Multiclient Creator was a Tool to patch the starting mutex of the game NosTale. Since the official client now supports running the client multiple times natively the MCC is only relevant for starting the game with the old authentication method or creating clients with modified endpoints for private servers.

Multiclient Creator was one of my first public projects and is one of the most known and used tools for NosTale.
